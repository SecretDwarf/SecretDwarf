**About Me**

Hello! My name is Jacob Briggs, and I am 18 and currently working through my last semester to graduate with a bachelor's degree in software engineering from BYU-Idaho. I have a strong passion for web development and software design, which you can explore in my portfolio at [jacobbriggs.us](https://jacobbriggs.us). My portfolio has my resume, projects, and contact information if you'd like to interact with me more. 

In addition to my academic life, I am excited to announce that I will be serving a two-year LDS mission in Dallas, Texas, starting September 23, 2024. This mission is a wonderful opportunity for personal and spiritual growth.

I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring new opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me for any collaborations or inquiries.
